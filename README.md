> [!WARNING] 
> ### Deploy your own instance! Don't use mine

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you can't deploy, have issues - mind them yourself. I am not here to help anybody. Ask chatGPT, Google, YouTube, whatever... I have many other things to do. This repo created just to share my work, as I used another public repo.  

## After a deploy, simply navigate to root directory (you will see the domain, generated by vercel right after deploy)

## How to Deploy?

- `fork` this repo
- go to vercel, you have to register and link your github. It's free and easy
- create new project
- import your fork
- and press "deploy"

In other words, this is completely free and easy to do. You can find many videos and articles with tutorials
