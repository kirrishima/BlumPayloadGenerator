# @BlumCryptoBot drop game payload generator server

> [!WARNING] 
> ### Deploy your own instance! Don't use mine

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you can't deploy, have issues - mind them yourself. I am not here to help anybody. Ask chatGPT, Google, YouTube, whatever... I have many other things to do. This repo created just to share my work, as I used another public repo.  

## After a deploy, simply navigate to root directory (you will see the domain, generated by vercel right after deploy)

## How to Deploy?

- `fork` this repo
- go to vercel, you have to register and link your github. It's free and easy
- create new project
- import your fork
- and press "deploy"

In other words, this is completely free and easy to do. You can find many videos and articles with tutorials

## Repo Structure Explained

- **dist** folder: Contains compiled code generated from the **src** folder where `.ts` (TypeScript) code is located. 
  - The content in **dist** is generated by compiling `.ts` files.
  - This folder is included because there were issues with building directly on Vercel.

## How to Run

1. Install all dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Compile `.ts` files:
   ```bash
   npx tsc
   ```

> [!NOTE]
>  This project is not designed to run on localhost. It is intended only for deployment on Vercel.
